About
-------------------------------

<i>Nano</i> is a startpage with a simple layout.

Startpages are locally hosted, usually, webpage that serves as a homepage for your browser.

Instruction
-------------------------------

<strong>Step 1 : Right click on the <i>.htm</i> file and open it with a browser of your choice</strong>


<strong>Step 2 : Set the startpage as the homepage </strong>

<ol> 
<li> create a github account and fork this repository.</li>
<li> download <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop</a>, go to File/Options and Sign in with your current account.</li>
<li> go to File/Clone repository and select the one you forked (it'll be named <i>Username/Nano</i>). </li>
<li> click the <i>Current branch</i> tab and select <i>gh-pages</i>. Then go to Repository/Show in Explorer to customize the startpage. After modifying what you want, return to Github Desktop window and click the button <i>Commit to gh-pages</i> (you'll have to write a title in Summary before).</li>
<li> finally, click the button <i>Push origin</i>. After 10 minutes or less, you'll be able to go to https://username.github.io/Nano/.</li>
<li> go to your browser setting and set https://username.github.io/Nano/ as your default homepage.</li>
<li> download the add-on <i>New Tab Override</i> (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-override/fjcmlondipcnnpmbcollgifldmajfonf?hl=en-GB">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/">Firefox Mozilla</a>), go to options and select <i>current home page</i></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 3 : Install the font </strong>

I use several fonts for the startpage.
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://www.freejapanesefont.com/kf-himaji/">KFhimaji</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto">Roboto</a></li>
</ol>

Features
-------------------------------

<span><i>Eden</i> has one main feature.</span>
<ol>
<li>In the search bar, by entering some special keys, such as <i>-y jazz music</i>, you'll be able to search directly on youtube and not on Google. Another exemple with `-w moe`, it'll search 'moe' on wikipedia.</li>
</ol>

Customizing
-------------------------------

### Search
- open the `js` folder and edit `search.js` in a text editor , you'll have to modify the following code 
``` javascript
case "-u":
query = query.substr(3);
window.location = "https://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=" 
break;
```
- first, you have to decide of a website (I will take bato.to) and a special key for this said site : I will take -b, thus you'll have the following code

``` javascript
case "-b":
query = query.substr(3);
window.location = "https://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=" 
break;
```
- after that, you'll need to replace the value of `window.location`, in the example of batoto you'll have to go to the site and search for something, for example if I'm looking for Hinamatsuri (a pretty gud manga, you should read it asap), the link will be `http://bato.to/search?name=Hinamatsuri&name_cond=c`, you'll have to copy the link before 'Hinamatsuri', namely `http://bato.to/search?name=`, and you'll have the following code 

``` javascript
case "-b":
query = query.substr(3);
window.location = "http://bato.to/search?name=" 
break;
```
